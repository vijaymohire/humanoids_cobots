Humans have consciousness, is it possible for non-biological entities to have consciousness?; if yes, then why not Quantum AI (QAI) machines possess this?

Research and experiments are making some progress, especially related to quantum principles. This article offers an introduction to this topic. There are many questions and hypothesis researcher are working on. Neven suggests consciousness could be the mechanism by which humans experience one specific branch of this multiverse. It shows that we live in parallel worlds and each of this may have various dimensions say 3, 4 and even more than 10 dimensions as per theories like the string theory. Our body is limited to 3D world however our brain/ mind works at a quantum level and can perceive higher dimensions. This is where the real work starts. So why not humanoids posses consciousness?. This is the hot topic that can help machines to gain and use the benefits of consciousness that can make robots get better. Newer theories in quantum memory and higher dimensional computing can help in this research. 

I am sure this can be a breakthrough where by machines can get common human sense and offer humans great value on projects where humans cannot risk. Related link: https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/01/11/is-consciousness-research-the-next-big-quantum-use-case/
